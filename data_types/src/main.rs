    // SIDE NOTE (Requesting an index larger than the arrays index)

    /* The compilation didnâ€™t produce any errors, but the program resulted in a *runtime* error and didnâ€™t exit successfully.
     When you attempt to access an element using indexing, Rust will check that the index 
    youâ€™ve specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to 
    the array length, Rust will panic.
    This is the first example of Rustâ€™s safety principles in action. 
    In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, 
    invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing. 
    Chapter 9 discusses more of Rustâ€™s error handling. */
